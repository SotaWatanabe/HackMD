# Our Journey on Polkadot
We started making Plasm Network back in 2019. Since then, we have delivered a lot of technical features and products in the Polkadot ecosystem. So far, it was a  great journey but we are still at the  very early stage of Web3.0 movement. 

Prior to the upcoming Parachain auction, I though it was  a good time to look back on our journey and announce next steps.
